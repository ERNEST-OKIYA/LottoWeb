                            In the event that any funds are mistakenly credited to or deducted from your account, we are
                            entitled to make the appropriate adjustments. If any funds are incorrectly credited to or
                            deducted from your account, you must notify us of the errors immediately, and not more than
                            30 days following the transaction in question. Funds credited to Customer Funds in error
                            cannot be used to place an order and the Operator reserves the right to void any transaction
                            involving such funds. For the avoidance of doubt, when the Customer has a credit balance and
                            further sums are erroneously added to this balance, the Customer is permitted to transact up
                            to the level of funds available in their Account excluding the erroneously added funds. If
                            you withdraw any funds incorrectly credited to your account, JISORTLOTTERY may withhold that
                            amount from any deposit or prize winnings, or seek recovery. If you use any funds
                            incorrectly credited to your account to purchase a Promotion ticket, JISORTLOTTERY shall
                            deem the purchase void and will refuse to pay any prize or recover any prize already paid.
                            You agree to indemnify JISORTLOTTERY for any erroneously credited funds that you have
                            withdrawn. Any decision in respect of any other matter or dispute arising from any disputed
                            credit or debit shall be final and binding upon all Participants and any other person or
                            persons having any interest in the matter or dispute. Please be aware that we will not

                            is disputed. If we, in our sole discretion, find that an amount has been wrongfully charged
                            we will, as your sole remedy, refund you that amount.
